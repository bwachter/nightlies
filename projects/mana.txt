This directory contains nightly Windows builds of the Mana client. Starting
with 20100201 only one binary is used to support both ManaServ and Eathena.

- mana-*-win32.exe contains the full installer package
- mana-*.zip is a ZIP file containing just the binary (mana.exe)
- patches.* contains all the patches used for building the package at
  that specific date

Usually it should be sufficient to download the installer once, and just replace
mana.exe in the installation directory with newer versions.

If you experience any problems do a complete uninstall, and try again with the
newest version available.

Old builds are kept for one week.
